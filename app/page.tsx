            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed text-lg">
              Garage Door Repair of Coral Springs is a licensed, locally operated garage door company serving homeowners
              across Northwest Broward County since 2010. We repair broken springs, malfunctioning openers, off-track doors, worn
              cables, and faulty sensors — typically the same day you call. Our technicians carry parts for every major
              brand including LiftMaster, Chamberlain, and Genie, so most repairs are completed in a single visit.

            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mt-3">
              South Florida&apos;s heat, humidity, and salt air are uniquely hard on garage door hardware. Galvanized cables
              corrode faster than in drier climates. Torsion springs weaken sooner. Nylon rollers expand and bind in
              summer heat. Our technicians understand the South Florida climate and recommend hardware designed to last
              in Broward County conditions — not just generic national-brand recommendations.

                Since 2010, our technicians have repaired thousands of garage doors across Coral Springs and the greater
                Northwest Broward County area. We&apos;re not a national franchise — we&apos;re a local team that knows the specific
                challenges of South Florida homeownership. From the HOA regulations in Eagle Trace and Turtle Run to the
                hurricane-rated door requirements common throughout Broward County, we bring local expertise that national
                call centers simply can&apos;t match.

              <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                Every technician on our team is licensed and insured in the state of Florida. We work on all major garage
                door brands — LiftMaster, Chamberlain, Genie, Amarr, Clopay, and Wayne Dalton — and we stock the most
                common replacement parts on our service vehicles so your door is repaired on the first visit whenever
                possible.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                Florida&apos;s climate demands quality hardware. We recommend galvanized springs and stainless steel cables
                specifically designed for coastal environments. In communities like Wyndham Lakes, Heron Bay in Parkland, and
                Maplewood, where HOAs maintain high standards, getting the right door and the right hardware the first time
                matters.

                Florida&apos;s coastal climate is uniquely harsh on garage door hardware. Salt air corrodes springs and
                cables. Humidity warps panels and seals. Heat causes rollers to bind. Our technicians use galvanized and
                stainless hardware specifically rated for South Florida conditions — not generic parts that fail within a year.

              <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                Our technicians don&apos;t just patch problems. We perform a full safety inspection on every visit —
                checking the counterbalance system, testing the photoelectric sensors and safety reverse function,
                lubricating the track and rollers, and inspecting the bottom seal and weatherstripping for Florida storm
                readiness. You get a door that works right and is safe for your family.

                Trace, or a luxury custom door in Heron Bay in Parkland, our work is guaranteed. We explain exactly what
                needs repair and why, provide honest pricing before we start, and don&apos;t leave until you&apos;re satisfied.
