              <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                Garage Door Repair of Coral Springs is a locally owned and operated garage door service company
                serving homeowners throughout Coral Springs, Parkland, and the surrounding northwest Broward County
                communities. We were founded in {SITE.founded} with a straightforward mission: provide fast, reliable,
                and fairly priced garage door service to the South Florida neighborhoods we live and work in.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                Over the years we&apos;ve built our reputation one repair at a time — showing up when we say we will,
                diagnosing honestly, and completing the job correctly on the first visit. We serve Wyndham Lakes,
                Eagle Trace, Turtle Run, Ridgewood, Maplewood, Heron Bay in Parkland, and every neighborhood in between.
                Our business address is in Parkland, which means Heron Bay and the northwest Broward communities are
                home territory for our technicians.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                We are fully licensed and insured for all residential and light commercial garage door work in
                Broward County. Every technician on our team is trained on current Florida Building Code requirements
                and experienced with the specific climate challenges that South Florida garage doors face: extreme
                humidity and salt air that corrodes bare steel hardware, hurricane wind-load requirements that apply
                to every door we install, and the HOA architectural standards that govern new door installations in
                Coral Springs&apos; many planned communities.
              </p>

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-navy mb-4">Our Approach</h2>
              <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                We believe in giving homeowners the information they need to make good decisions — not upselling
                parts that aren&apos;t needed or recommending replacement when repair is the right call. When we arrive,
                we inspect the full door system, identify the root cause of the problem, and give you a written quote
                before any work begins. No surprises. No pressure.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                Same-day service is our standard, not a premium add-on. If you call before noon on most days, we
                can typically get a technician to you by late afternoon. We operate 7 days a week from 7 AM to 8 PM
                to accommodate the schedules of working Coral Springs families.
              </p>
