        <div className="max-w-4xl mx-auto px-4">
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-navy mb-4">Torsion vs. Extension Springs: What&apos;s the Difference?</h2>
          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
            Every residential garage door relies on a counterbalance system — either torsion springs mounted on a shaft
            above the door opening, or extension springs running along the horizontal tracks on each side. Understanding
            which type you have matters because they fail differently and require different replacement techniques.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
            <strong>Torsion springs</strong> store energy by winding tight when the door closes and unwinding to lift
            the door. They&apos;re the gold standard for modern double-car garage doors in Coral Springs communities
            like Eagle Trace and Turtle Run — more durable, safer when they snap, and easier to balance precisely.
            A single torsion spring replacement costs $150–$280; a double torsion setup runs $220–$400.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
            <strong>Extension springs</strong> stretch and contract along the track. They&apos;re common on older and
            lighter single-car doors found in Wyndham Lakes and Ridgewood. When an extension spring snaps, it can fly
            across the garage — a serious hazard unless safety cables are installed. We always add safety cables during
            extension spring replacement if they aren&apos;t already present. Extension spring replacement runs $150–$300
            depending on door size.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-navy mb-4">Why Springs Break — Especially in South Florida</h2>
          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
            Standard garage door springs are rated for 10,000 open/close cycles — roughly 7–10 years for a household
            using the door four times per day. But in Coral Springs and the broader Broward County area, three
            environmental factors accelerate spring fatigue significantly:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 text-gray-700 space-y-2 mb-6">
            <li>
              <strong>High humidity (85%+ in summer):</strong> Metal springs oxidize faster in South Florida&apos;s
              coastal air. Without galvanized hardware and regular lubrication, springs can lose 20–30% of their
              service life.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Salt air from the Atlantic:</strong> Properties throughout Coral Springs — within 30 miles of
              the coast — see accelerated corrosion on ungalvanized springs and cables. Heron Bay in Parkland and
              other communities near cypress sloughs face near-constant moisture exposure.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Temperature cycling:</strong> While South Florida avoids freezing temperatures, the 40–50°F
              swing between winter nights and summer days causes metal fatigue in springs that are not properly
              maintained.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
            We address these issues by using galvanized springs as our default — not an upgrade — and applying a
            lithium-grease treatment to every spring we install. For homeowners in Maplewood and other Coral Springs
            communities near water features, where moisture is a near-constant factor, we also recommend our high-cycle
            25,000-cycle springs as a long-term investment.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-navy mb-4">Can I DIY My Garage Door Spring? (Why You Shouldn&apos;t)</h2>
          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
            Torsion springs are wound under 100–200 ft-lbs of torque. Improper winding — using a screwdriver instead
            of proper winding bars, losing grip during the process, or miscounting turns — can send a steel bar flying
            across your garage at dangerous speed. The Consumer Product Safety Commission documents dozens of serious
            injuries annually from DIY spring replacement attempts.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
            Beyond the safety risk, incorrect tension will leave your door off-balance: the opener strains to compensate,
            shortening its motor life by years. Sensors go out of alignment. Cables unspool unevenly and fray. A
            $30 spring purchase can cascade into a $600 repair bill. Our licensed technicians carry proper calibration
            tools, correct the full counterbalance system, and test the door through 10 complete open/close cycles
            before leaving.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-navy mb-4">What Happens if You Ignore a Broken Spring?</h2>
          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
            Most garage door openers will attempt to lift a door even with a broken spring — but they&apos;re not
            designed for it. Running a standard residential opener against an unbalanced or fully manual-weight door
            burns out the motor within days. You&apos;ll also risk:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 text-gray-700 space-y-2 mb-6">
            <li>Cables snapping under the extra load — expensive secondary failure</li>
            <li>Door rollers jumping the track</li>
            <li>Opener trolley and carriage damage</li>
            <li>In worst cases, the door crashing down if the opener disengages</li>
          </ul>
          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
            The moment you notice any of the warning signs — loud bang, door barely lifting, uneven hanging — call us.
            Same-day response is available across Coral Springs including Wyndham Lakes, Eagle Trace, Turtle Run,
